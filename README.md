This repository is focused on building an Ordinary Least Square Regression model that generates signals for predicting the growth of the SPY (Exchange-Traded Fund tracking the S&P500) based on a diverse set of global market indices, including the indices from the USA Market, European Market, Asian and Australian Market. The primary focus is predicting price changes in SPY, a cost-effective and frequently traded asset closely tied to the S&P500 index.

The Coursera course- Python and Statistics for Financial Analysis- inspired this project. Accordingly, the Yahoo Finance datasets were utilized to build a trading strategy.
